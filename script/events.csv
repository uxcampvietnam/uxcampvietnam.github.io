Chef Hai, born in Hà Nội, Việt Nam, moved to France at 18. He developed his skills in Michelin-starred restaurants and hosted pop-ups in Paris, showcasing his unique cooking style and creating memorable experiences.

Talk about his cooking style, Hai likes to use classic techniques combined with new ingredients as well as playing around with flavours. His cuisine is mostly French with influences from Việt Nam, Argentina, China, Italy and so much more as it retraces his culinary story.

And Chef Hai is here to tell you all about that. After a decade abroad, now he's back in his beloved hometown, ready to conquer new challenges and bring a little taste of Paris to Hà Nội, alongside with Chef Hieu at Déglacer.
